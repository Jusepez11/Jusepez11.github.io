        <img src="images/Yo.JPG" alt="This is me Paraglading near Montañita, Ecuador">
        <p class="me"><strong>Personal background:</strong> Born and raised in Ecuador, moved here in 2016, I like to cook, and fix phones in my spare time, I love traveling, but I’m mainly a homebody.</p>
        <p class="me"><strong>Professional Background:</strong> My first couple of jobs have been in fast food, really nice jobs, I really like the adrenaline rush from fast food, but I hate it finishing work and my skin and hair being all greasy, after I’ve started working with T-mobile where I got to meet various people, it was a really nice job, after that I work for target for a bit, but wasnt really my thing, and now im back with T-mobile in carolina mall, so if you need to lower your bill give me a visit!</p>
        <p class="me"><strong>Academic Background:</strong> Going for my bachelor degree in Comp. Sci. with a concentration in Software Engineering.</p>
        <p class="me"><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I have no major Background in this subject, in high school I took an adobe Dreamweaver course, and so I have a basic knowledge of html. However I am pretty excited to see just what will I be able to do and get out of this course.</p>
        <p class="me"><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> I’m between Windows and Linux (I use arch btw), I’ll probably just use windows, because the computer I use linux on has a touch screen and I havent been able to make it work and I’m losing a lot of its value.</p>
        <p class="me"><strong>Courses I'm in &amp; Why:</strong> (all the classes im taking this semester are requirements)</p>

        <ul>
        <li class="me"><strong>ITCS - 3160 Database Design and Implementation:</strong> I’m not too sure how to feel about this class, so far we’ve seen a bit of SQL but I’m stoked, SQL seems pretty interesting and I’m excited to learn!</li>
        <li class="me"><strong>ITSC - 3146 Intro Oper Syst &amp; Networking:</strong> This one I wasn’t too sure what to expect at first, but so far we’ve been working with C++ and we’ve been using a Linux virtual machine, and it’s pretty cool, it feels nice how familiar I am with the operating system, given how simple Ubuntu is.</li>
        <li class="me"><strong>ITIS - 3135 Web App Design and Development:</strong> Honestly, I expected to really not like this class, with all due respect, it was the one I was the least interested in, but so far is the one I'm the most excited about, and I can’t wait to see where this takes us. The fact that I was able to learn how to make my GitHub repo look like a website and that UNCC gives us our own server has me stoked, and I’m so interested in messing around with that to make many things.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="me"><strong>Funny/Interesting Item about Yourself:</strong> I gave up on beating the hollow radiance in Hollow Knight.</p>
        <p class="me"><strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong> I like helping people, so if anyone wants to work together to do homework or anything of the sort, even if I don’t know the answer I’ll be able to figure it out for the team!</p>
