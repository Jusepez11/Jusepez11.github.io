        <h1>Website CRAP Evaluation</h1>
        <h2><a class="crap" href="https://makefrontendshitagain.party/">Make Front End Shist Again</a></h2>
        <p>The website "Make Frontend Shit Again" is a humorous, nostalgic tribute to the early days of web development, embracing the chaotic, fun nature of retro web design. It features bold, flashy elements like animated GIFs, neon colors, and references to outdated technologies like FTP, jQuery, and Geocities. The message encourages web developers to bring back creativity and playfulness to frontend design, urging users to build "dumb" and "useless" but fun websites again.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Contrast:</b> It lacks clear contrast, using flashy, chaotic colors that don't always distinguish important elements.</li>
            <li><b>Repetition:</b> The design lacks consistent patterns, which can confuse users about visual hierarchy.</li>
            <li><b>Alignment:</b> Elements are randomly placed without structure, disrupting visual flow.</li>
            <li><b>Proximity:</b> Irrelevant elements are grouped together, making it hard to distinguish related content.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a class="crap" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a></h2>
        <p>W3Schools is a popular platform for learning web development. It offers tutorials on a wide variety of topics including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and more. Its structure is straightforward, providing examples, code editors, and exercises.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Contrast:</b> W3Schools uses high contrast between text and background, typically with dark text on a light background and vice versa for headers. This makes content highly readable and important elements easy to spot.</li>
            <li><b>Repetition:</b> The site maintains a consistent layout across all tutorials. Repetitive use of fonts, colors, and buttons strengthens user familiarity and navigability.</li>
            <li><b>Alignment:</b> Everything on the page, from headings to code snippets, is well-aligned, making the site easy to follow and visually structured.</li>
            <li><b>Proximity:</b> Related content, such as navigation menus and tutorials, is grouped together, helping users easily find what they need. Text and images are appropriately spaced, improving readability.</li>
